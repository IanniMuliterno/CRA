Curious about the sentiment of your favourite artists? And how do they compare to other artists? Are specific artists changing their musical style over time? And do they vary more in their musical creativity than others? Answers to these type of questions can be found in this app that is inspired, in part, by one of last yearâ€™s winning submissions, the Sentify(opens in a new tab) app.

We loved the clean UI of this app and the interactivity when selecting artists. The various data visualisations and the consistent use of color in them is quite striking as well! We should also note that this app won one of the Grand Prizes in the novice category with app developers having less than 1 year experience with Shiny!
